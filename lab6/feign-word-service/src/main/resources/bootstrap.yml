# Depending on which profile is active, the application gives 
# itself a different name when registering with Eureka

#---
## Now we have moved sentence webservice to a different project so commenting below lines
#spring:
#  profiles: sentence
#  application:
#    name: word-restservices-sentence

## Allow Eureka to recognize two apps of the same type on the same host as separate instances:
#eureka:
#  instance:
#    metadataMap:
#      instanceId: ${spring.application.name}:${spring.application.instance_id:${random.value}}
